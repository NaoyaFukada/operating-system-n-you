To change permissions:
  - chmod
  - Permission set:
    - u: owner
    - g: Group
    - o: Other users
  - To add or remove permissions, just use a plus or minus symbol that indicates who the permission effects.

To change permissions numerically:
  - The numerical equivalent of rws is:
    - 4 for read or r
    - 2 for write or w
    - 1 for execute or x

Meaning of 'rwsr-xr-x':
  - r: Read permission. The file can be read.
  - w: Write permission. The file can be modified.
  - s: Setuid bit. When applied to an executable file, it allows the file to be executed with the permissions of the file owner.
  - x: Execute permission. The file can be executed as a program.
  - Also, this order separated by '-' is the user group. From the left, owner permission, group permission, and other user permission.
  


Setuid (Set User ID): 
  - This is a special permission in Linux that allows users to run an executable file with the file owner's permissions, not just their own. For example, when you change your 
    password, the command needs to access and modify files that are usually only accessible by the root user, like the /etc/shadow file. With setuid permission set on the 
    command's executable file, when you run the command, it temporarily gains root permissions to modify these protected files, even though you're not logged in as root. 
    This way, setuid enables specific tasks that require elevated privileges without giving users full root access, enhancing both functionality and security.
