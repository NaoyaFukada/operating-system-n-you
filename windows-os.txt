CLI availables on Windows:
  - Command Prompt: cmd.exe
    - Command Prompt, known as cmd.exe, has been part of Windows operating systems for a long time, carrying over many functionalities 
      from the older MS-DOS system.
  - Powershell: powershell.exe
    - PowerShell is a more powerful and modern command line interface compared to Command Prompt. It was introduced to extend the 
      capabilities of the traditional Command Prompt.

Windows Search Service: 
  - This is a feature in Windows that indexes files on your computer. It scans through the files at scheduled times and compiles a list of 
    names, properties, and other details into a database. This process can be resource-intensive, so on many Windows servers, it's either 
    not installed or disabled. However, it's often enabled for files in the home directory on Windows 8 and Windows 10 desktop computers. 
    By default, it allows you to find files based on their name, path, last modified time, size, and other details. You can configure it to 
    search within file contents, but this makes indexing slower.
  - Configuring Windows Search Service: 
    - To enable searching within file contents, you need to adjust the settings. This is done through the Control Panel, specifically under 
      'Indexing Options'. Here, you can modify settings for various folders (like the Users folder), and choose to index properties and file 
      contents. This re-indexing can take time, depending on the number of files and their size.
