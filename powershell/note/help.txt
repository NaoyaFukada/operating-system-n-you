Get-Alias:
  - This is used to display the actual cmdlet (command) that an alias represents. PowerShell aliases are essentially shorthand or nicknames 
    for the longer cmdlet names. When you use an alias in PowerShell, it's a convenient way to call a more complex or verbose cmdlet without 
    having to type out the full name.
  - For example, if you use the alias ls in PowerShell, it's actually an alias for the Get-ChildItem cmdlet. Using "Get-Alias ls" will reveal 
    this association. This command helps you understand what's happening behind the scenes when you use these shorter aliases, and it's 
    particularly useful for learning the actual PowerShell cmdlets associated with the more familiar, often Unix-like, command names.
