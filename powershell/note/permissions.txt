Access Control Lists (ACLs):
  - ACLs are used in Windows to define security and access permissions for files and directories.
  - An ACL is a collection of Access Control Entries (ACEs), each specifying access rights for a user or a group of users.
  - ACLs help determine who can access a particular resource and what actions they can perform (like read, write, execute).

Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs):
  - This is a note about who can use a file and what they are allowed to do with it.
  - DACLs are a type of ACL that owners of a file or resource use to specify who can access that resource and in what manner.
  - They contain ACEs that grant or deny permissions to users or groups.
  - The "discretionary" part means that the resource owner or someone with permission to set security can change the DACL.

System Access Control Lists (SACLs):
  - This is used to tell Windows that it should use an event log to make a note of every time someone access a file or a folder
  - SACLs are used to specify audit settings for a file or directory.
  - They are not about granting access but about logging attempts to access a resource.
  - SACLs determine which attempts to access a resource should be logged in the security log, such as successful or failed read, write, or execute attempts.

Permissions in Windows ACLs:
  - Read: 
    - This permission allows a user to view and read the contents of a file or to list the files and subdirectories within a directory.
  - Read & Execute: 
    - In addition to the permissions granted by "Read", this allows the execution of files; primarily important for files that are executable (like .exe or script files). 
      For directories, it includes the ability to traverse the directory.
  - List Folder Contents: 
    - This is an alias for "Read & Execute" but is applied specifically to directories, allowing a user to list the files and subdirectories 
      within them and to execute files within the directory.
  - Write: 
    - Grants the capability to modify the contents of a file or to add new files or subdirectories within a directory. It's important to 
      note that "Write" does not inherently include the ability to read the file.
  - Modify: 
    - This is a more comprehensive permission that includes "Read", "Write", and "Execute". It allows for reading, writing, modifying, 
      and executing files in a directory or the directory itself.
  - Full Control: 
    - The most extensive permission, granting a user all the capabilities of "Modify" along with additional administrative powers like 
      changing permissions (modifying the ACL) and taking ownership of the file or directory.

Certain permissions and inheritance flags:
  - OI (Object Inherit): 
    - This flag indicates that the permissions applied will also be inherited by files within the folder. It means that any new file created 
      in or moved to the "C:\Vacation Pictures" directory will inherit the permissions specified by this command.
    - Any file directly within the folder will inherit the specified permissions.
  - CI (Container Inherit): 
    - Similar to OI, but this flag specifies that the permissions will be inherited by subdirectories within the folder. Any new 
      subdirectory created in or moved to the "C:\Vacation Pictures" directory will inherit these permissions.
    - The permissions set on the parent folder are inherited by subfolders (the "containers"), so the files inside the 
      subfolders can also inherit permissions.
  - R (Read):
    - This is the actual permission being granted and stands for "Read" permission. It allows viewing the folder's contents and opening its 
      files but not modifying, deleting, or creating new files within it.

Simple Permissions:
  - Overview: 
    - Simple permissions are user-friendly, predefined sets of permissions that cover common use cases for managing file and folder access. They are designed to 
      be easily applied without needing to understand the underlying complexities.
  - Example: 
    - When you assign the "Read" permission to a file or folder, you're actually enabling a combination of several special permissions like listing folder contents 
      and reading file data.

Special Permissions:
  - Overview: 
    - Special permissions are more granular and specific than simple permissions, allowing for detailed control over how users and groups interact with files and folders.
  - Example: 
    - Special permissions include actions like "List folder / read data," "Read attributes," "Read extended attributes," and "Read permissions." 
      These can be individually assigned to create custom access rules beyond what is offered by simple permissions.

icacls C:\Windows\Temp:
  - Command Use: 
    - The icacls command is used to view and modify the access control lists (ACLs) of files and directories. For example, icacls C:\Windows\Temp displays or modifies 
      permissions for the C:\Windows\Temp directory, which is used by the system and applications to store temporary files.
  - Special Context: 
    - The command can be used to ensure that all users can create files and folders in C:\Windows\Temp but cannot delete files created by others.
