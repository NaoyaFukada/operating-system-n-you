Recurse: 
  - The "-Recurse" parameter in PowerShell commands with cp (Copy-Item) instructs the command to operate not only on the specified items 
    but also on all items in its subdirectories. This is particularly useful when dealing with folders, as it ensures that all nested files 
    and subfolders are included in the operation. Without -Recurse, a command that involves a directory will only act on the directory itself 
    and not its contents.

Verbose: 
  - The "-Verbose" parameter in PowerShell provides detailed information about the operation being performed. When used with a command, 
    it causes the command to give more detailed output, such as indicating each action it performs or each file it processes. 
    This is especially useful for tracking what a script or command is doing, particularly for troubleshooting or for understanding 
    the behavior of a script.
