Select-String (sls) in PowerShell: 
  - This is a PowerShell command used to search for text patterns in files. It's a versatile tool that can find words, phrases, or more 
    complex patterns defined by regular expressions. For instance, if you run "Select-String cow farm-animal.txt", it will search for the 
    word "cow" in the file farm-animal.txt.

Pattern Matching with Select-String: 
  - When you want to search through multiple files, you can use pattern matching. For example, Select-String cow *.txt searches for the 
    word "cow" in all .txt files in the current directory. The asterisk (*) is a wildcard character that represents any number of 
    characters, allowing you to search across multiple files.
    
Search Filter:
  - The "-Filter" parameter is used to specify a search pattern for file names. When you use this parameter, PowerShell filters the results 
    to include only those files that match the pattern you've provided. For example, if you use -Filter *.exe, PowerShell will return only 
    the files with an .exe extension. The asterisk (*) in *.exe acts as a wildcard, meaning it will match any characters preceding 
    the .exe extension. This parameter is efficient because it applies the filter at the source, reducing the amount of data that PowerShell 
    needs to process further.
